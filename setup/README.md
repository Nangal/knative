# Setup

These are the steps to set Knative and its dependencies.

## Configuration

Edit [config](config) file for your setup.

## Create a GKE cluster

Create a GKE cluster *without* Istio add-on. We do this because the Istio version of the add-on usually lags behind what Knative expects:

```sh
./create-gke-cluster
```

## Install Istio

There's now an installation script for Istio in
[net-istio](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio.git) repo. Script
seems to assume Linux (didn't work on MacOS for me), so I suggest to run it in
Cloud Shell, if you don't have a Linux environment.

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio.git
```

Install stable Istio with minimal Istio configuration:

```sh
cd net-istio/third_party/istio-stable
./install-istio.sh istio-minimal.yaml
```

You can check if Istio installed properly with:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n istio-system
```

## Install Knative Serving

```sh
./install-serving
```

## Install Knative Eventing

```sh
./install-eventing
```

## (Optional) Install observability features

Install observability features to enable logging, metrics, and request tracing in Serving and Eventing components:

```sh
./install-monitoring
```

## (Optional) Install Knative with GCP

If you intend to read Google Cloud events, install [Knative GCP](https://github.com/google/knative-gcp) components.

There are 2 ways of setting up authentication in Knative GCP:

1. Kubernetes secrets
2. Workload identity

Workload identity is the recommended mechanism but we have scripts for both.
Pick one of the mechanisms and use appropriate scripts.

Install Knative with GCP:

```sh
# Kubernetes secrets
./install-knative-gcp

# Workload identity
./install-knative-gcp workload
```

Configure a Pub/Sub enabled Service Account for Data Plane:

```sh
# Kubernetes secrets
./install-dataplane-serviceaccount

# Workload identity
./install-dataplane-serviceaccount workload
```
